The Kiota Authentication provider library for PHP uses the [PHP League OAuth 2.0 client](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/) to authenticate against the Microsoft Identity platform.

A [Kiota](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota) generated project will need a reference to a authentication provider library to authenticate HTTP requests to an API endpoint.
